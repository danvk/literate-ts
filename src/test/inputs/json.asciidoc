literate-ts will check that your JSON code samples are valid JSON.

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "repository": {
      "createdAt": "2014-06-17T15:28:39Z",
      "description":
        "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to JavaScript."
    }
  }
}
----

Or rather, that they're valid JSONC (JSON with Comments):

[source,json]
----
{
    "a": 12, // comments allows
    "b": 23, // so are trailing commas
}
----
