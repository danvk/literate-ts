This code sample is commented out but has a type error:

////
// verifier:prepend-to-following
[source,ts]
----
const value: number = "123";
----
////

It's prepended to the next code block, where it also produces a surprise error, but the error spans should be clamped so that they don't appear on random text elsewhere in the doc.

Here you go:

[source,ts]
----
console.log(value);
//          ^? const value: number
----
