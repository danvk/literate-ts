You can also define replacements inline in your file, presumably hidden away in a comment. This is done using the `replace-with-id` directive. Here's an example of that in action.

// verifier:replace-with-id:calculate-age-replacement
[source,ts]
----
function calculateAge(birthDate: Date): number {
  // ...
}
----

////
[[calculate-age-replacement]]
[source,ts]
----
function calculateAge(birthDate: Date): number {
  // COMPRESS
  return 0;
  // END
}
----
////

And here's an example of that failing to match. Note that the replacement and the original may be defined in either order.

// verifier:replace-with-id:calculate-age-replacement
[source,ts]
----
function calculateAge(birthDate: string): number {
  // ...
}
----
