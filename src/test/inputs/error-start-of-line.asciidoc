This code sample has an error at the very start of the line. It's awkward to put a `~~~` here, so an alternate syntax is allowed:

[source,ts]
----
x = 12;
// Error: Cannot find name 'x'.
----

This also works for indented code:

[source,ts]
----
{
  longname = 12;
  // Error: Cannot find name 'longname'.
}
----

If the error is not at the start of the line, a mismatch will be reported:

[source,ts]
----
console.log(x);
// Error: Cannot find name 'x'.

console.log(x);
//          ~ Cannot find name 'x'.
----
