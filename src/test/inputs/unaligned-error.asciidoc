The indicated error span in this snippet overlaps the true one, but it's not a subset of it:

[source,ts]
----
function foo(): number {
  //               ~~~~~~ A function whose declared type is neither
  //                      'undefined', 'void', nor 'any' must return a value.
  console.log('not gonna return!');
}
----

There is some wiggle room in error span matching at the start of a line. This is considered OK even though the span match isn't precise:

[source,ts]
----
{
  longname = 12;
  // ~~~~~ Cannot find name 'longname'.
}
----
