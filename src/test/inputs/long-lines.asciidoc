If your `package.json` has a `prettier` section, literate-ts will check the line lengths of code samples against prettier's `printWidth`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "prettier": {
    "printWidth": 81
  }
}
----

Line length limits are not enforced against code samples in commented-out blocks, even when they are prepended:

////
// verifier:prepend-to-following
[source,ts]
----
// This is an extremely long line. This is an extremely long line. This is an extremely long line. This is an extremely long line.
----
////

This is the only sample that should produce an error. (literate-ts sets `printWidth` to 100 for itself.)

[source,ts]
----
// This is also a long line. 100 characters ought to be enough for anyone. Don't you think that's true?
----

A program listing is fine, so long as it's less than the `printWidth` after HTML tags are stripped:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">&gt; <strong>["some", "text", "that", "is", "long", "but", "not", "too", "long"].length</strong>
9</pre>
++++
