literate-ts can strip irrelevant details from Node output like the name of the file being tested in a stack trace.

Here's an example of unsoundness in TypeScript:

// verifier:prepend-to-following
[source,ts]
----
const xs = [0, 1, 2];
//    ^? const xs: number[]
const x = xs[3];
//    ^? const x: number
----

The static type of `x` is `number` but its value at runtime is `undefined`. Here's how this can lead to problems:

[[unsound-code]]
[source,ts]
----
console.log(x.toFixed(1));
----

There are no type errors, but when you run this code it will throw an error:

[[unsound-code-output]]
----
console.log(x.toFixed(1));
              ^

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
----

The actual error looks like this:

----
file:///path/to/unsound-code.js:6
console.log(x.toFixed(1));
              ^

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')

But literate-ts has stripped out the file name, the stack trace and the Node version for us.
