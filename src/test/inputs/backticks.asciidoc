For instance, this is a valid TypeScript program:

[[greet-ts]]
```ts
function greet(who: string) {
  console.log('Hello', who);
}
```

Also, we have tsx!

[[greet-tsx]]
```tsx
export const Example = () => <div />;
```

But when you run this through a program like \`node\` that expects JavaScript, you'll get an error:

```
function greet(who: string) {
                  ^

SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
```

```ts
console.log("end of file");
