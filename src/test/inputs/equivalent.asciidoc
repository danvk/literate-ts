See https://github.com/danvk/literate-ts/issues/132 for context.

As of TS 4.2, `keyof` expressions resolve in an opaque and not very useful way:

// verifier:prepend-to-following
[source,ts]
----
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

type T = keyof Point;
//   ^? type T = keyof Point
----

You can use some https://effectivetypescript.com/2022/02/25/gentips-4-display/[machinery] to inline the type, but this usually distracts from the point of the text.

There's a special "equivalent to" syntax that quietly inserts some helper code to resolve the type behind the scenes:

[source,ts]
----
type T2 = keyof Point;
//   ^? type T2 = keyof Point (equivalent to "x" | "y")
----

Errors should be reported though probably not in a relevant location:

[source,ts]
----
type T2 = keyof Point;
//   ^? type T2 = keyof Point (equivalent to "x" | "y" | "z")
----

You can also split the assertion onto another line:

[source,ts]
----
type T2 = keyof Point;
//   ^? type T2 = keyof Point
//      (equivalent to "x" | "y" | "z")
----

You can use the same pattern with values as well as types:

[source,ts]
----
function foo(pt: Point) {
  let k: keyof Point;
  for (k in pt) {
    // ^? let k: keyof Point (equivalent to "x" | "y")
  }
}
----

This one should fail:

[source,ts]
----
function foo(pt: Point) {
  let k: keyof Point;
  for (k in pt) {
    // ^? let k: keyof Point (equivalent to "x" | "y" | "z")
  }
}
----
